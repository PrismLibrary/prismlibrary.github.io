The impact sliced open the train, which was traveling at 111 mph. Another 10 people were injured.<br /><br />The managers were charged with indirectly causing the deaths by not having required that the maintenance vehicle be blocked from the track while a train was on it.<br /><br />The Osnabrueck state court ruled that Guenter Steinmetz, 67, and Joerg Metzner, 50, were guilty of involuntary manslaughter and causing bodily harm through negligence. But Judge Dieter Temming said the two were not criminals.<br /><br />\"The accident was for them a professional catastrophe,\" Temming said.<br /><br />The court imposed fines of $37,800 and $31,500 respectively -- a punishment in line with what prosecutors had sought.<br /><br />The defense had sought the acquittal of the two men, who denied the accusations.

The story \r\nhints at what happened to him then jumps into the action, he said.<br><br>\"This\r\n is not an origin story,\" Feige said. \"We are assuming everyone buying a\r\n ticket will know Bruce Banner is a scientist on the run who grows into a\r\n green hulk 9 feet tall.

Neo (Keanu Reeves) \"The Matrix\"<br>(Andy &amp; Larry Wachowski, 1999)<br><br>In\r\n \"real life\" Neo is a reclusive computer hacker but when he lifts the \r\nvirtual reality cloak and enters the matrix he finds he is innately \r\ngifted. He can dodge bullets and has unimaginable strength but his true \r\nheroism stems from having the courage to fight the seemingly invincible \r\nMr Smith to try to free humanity from enslavement.<br><br>9. James Bond (Sean Connery) \"Dr No.\"<br>(Terence Young, 1962)<br><br>From\r\n the moment Connery\'s gentleman spy utters the words, \"The name\'s Bond, \r\nJames Bond,\" it\'s certain that for every pussy-stroking nemesis he \r\nencounters he will have just the right exploding pen, aquatic sports \r\ncar, or suave quip to prevail. Then he\'ll smooth down his tux and snog a\r\n babe safe in the knowledge he\'s saved the world once again.<br><br>8. Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) \"The Silence of the Lambs\"<br>(Jonathan Demme, 1991)<br><br>Starling,\r\n an ambitious FBI trainee, is in way over her head. She gets intimate \r\nwith Hannibal Lecter, a brilliant psychiatrist turned cannibal in the \r\nhopes he will give her clues in the hunt for mass murderer, Buffalo \r\nBill. When she inadvertently stumbles on Bill\'s underground lair, he \r\nblows the fuse and, terrifyingly, stalks her in night vision goggles. \r\nSome people might sit in a corner and whimper but not Starling -- with \r\nguts and determination she kills him and rescues his final victim.<br><br>7. Spartacus (Kirk Douglas) \"Spartacus\"<br>(Stanley Kubrick, 1960)<br><br>Spartacus\r\n has never been free. He is born a slave and trained to be a gladiator \r\nbut he revolts and leads a slave uprising in Italy. His rebellion is \r\nextraordinary successful -- the army numbers thousands and marches on \r\nRome. It is defeated in the end and Spartacus is crucified. But he dies \r\nunafraid because he knows it means his son will grow up a free man. In \r\nthe fight for his family\'s freedom he is a one man force for change.<br><br>6. Inspector \"Dirty\" Harry Callahan (Clint Eastwood), \'\'Dirty Harry\'\'<br>(Don Siegel, 1971)<br><br>Rules\r\n don\'t mean much to this alienated San Francisco cop when he\'s out \r\nhunting dangerous criminals. His methods are edgy but his attitude just \r\nseems to highlight the failings of the legal system and the weakness of \r\nhis superiors. The only thing he trusts is his .44 Magnum revolver and \r\nwhen cocks it at an unlucky robber and asks: \"Do ya feel lucky. Well, do\r\n ya punk?\" it\'s clear why this laconic anti-hero has had such a strong \r\ninfluence on pop culture.<br><br>5. Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) \"The Bourne Ultimatum\"<br>(Paul Greengrass, 2007)<br><br>Bourne\r\n is a highly trained killer suffering amnesia who the CIA just can\'t get\r\n rid of. Not only does he fight off their best assassins better than \r\nBruce Lee could, he has an impressive knack for improvising weapons from\r\n whatever he can lay his hands on -- a hardback book, a brass \r\ncandlestick, even a biro. A David and Goliath for the 21st century.<br><br>4. Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\"<br>(Stephen Spielberg, 1981)<br><br>Mostly\r\n he\'s a quiet-living archaeology professor but once in a while fate \r\nconspires to make Indy pick up his dented fedora and bullwhip and rescue\r\n a priceless relic from enemy hands. Not a nail-biting moment goes by \r\nwithout him getting into one scrape or another but aided by sardonic \r\none-liners and a great left hook he always triumphs in the end. Indy is \r\nno superhero -- just the hero we\'d all like to be.<br><br>3. Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) \"Aliens\"<br>(James Cameron, 1986)<br><br>\"Get\r\n away from her, you bitch!\" spits Ripley distracting the huge alien and \r\nallowing Newt, the child she has saved from the infested planet to \r\nescape. She\'s female but a she\'s a muscular warrior, soaked in sweat \r\nfrom from the gun-battle she\'s been waging on the terrible creatures. \r\nShe\'s like a furious lioness protecting her young -- and even the alien \r\nis no match for that.<br><br>2. Atticus Finch (Gregory Peck) \"To Kill a Mockingbird\"<br>(Robert Mulligan, 1962)<br><br>No\r\n fighting necessary for this quiet Southern lawyer who defends a black \r\nman accused of raping a white woman, despite calls from the community \r\nnot to. He is willing to do whatever it takes to uphold his values \r\nincluding standing up to a lynch mob who have come to kill his client. \r\nThe widower somehow also finds the time to be a solid, wise father \r\nfigure to his two children, Jem and Scout.<br><br>1. Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson) \"Schindler\'s List\"<br>(Stephen Spielberg, 1993)<br><br>Schindler\r\n is a hard-drinking, womanizing, fully paid-up member of the Nazi party \r\nwho wants nothing more than to make suitcases full of Reich marks out of\r\n the war. Yet his innate humanity shines through and -- despite \r\nimmediate risk to his own life -- he turns his factory into a haven for \r\nover 1,000 Jews who otherwise would probably have gone to their deaths \r\nat Auschwitz.</span>\r\n							</div><br>', null, null), ('52', 'French film wins Cannes\' top prize', '5', '2012-10-23', 'The French film \"The Class,\" a frank tale about classroom life using \r\nreal students and teachers at a junior high school, won top honors \r\nSunday<br>', '<img title=\"Image: http://www.myvivvo.com/thumbnail.php?file=art.del.toro.ap_900784891.jpg&amp;size=article_medium\" src=\"http://www.myvivvo.com/thumbnail.php?file=art.del.toro.ap_900784891.jpg&amp;size=article_medium\" alt=\"French film wins Cannes top prize\">\r\n										\r\n									<div>\r\n								\r\n                                \r\n								<span>The French film \"The Class,\" a frank tale about classroom \r\nlife using real students and teachers at a junior high school, won top \r\nhonors Sunday at the Cannes Film Festival.<br><br>Directed by Laurent \r\nCantet, \"The Class\" (\"Entre les Murs\") was the first French film to win \r\nthe main prize, the Palme d\'Or, at Cannes since \"Under Satan\'s Sun\" in \r\n1987.

Bush was only four months into his \r\npresidency, and Harrison Ford was just a young whippersnapper of 46.<br><br>Quite\r\n why Ford, Steven Spielberg and George Lucas -- three of the wealthiest \r\nmen in Hollywood -- should feel the need to resurrect Indiana Jones at \r\nthis late stage of the game is anybody\'s guess. The three men have a \r\ncombined age of 191, but like many boomers, they\'re not ready for the \r\nrest home just yet, even if living in the past seems a strange way to \r\nshow it.<br><br>The first Indiana Jones film, \"Raiders of the Lost Ark,\"\r\n was already a nostalgia trip when it was released in 1981, a guileless \r\ncelebration of the old-fashioned Saturday morning adventure serials that\r\n were a staple for any kid growing up in the \'30s, \'40s and \'50s.

If \r\nthe Nazis and the Reds couldn\'t finish him off, the \'60s surely would.<br><br>Still,\r\n in some ways, the extra years suit Ford. Indiana has always been a \r\nsurly old sourpuss, a pragmatic, world-weary hero in the classic WWII \r\nmold. Indy\'s fondness for griping is part of what makes him human. And \r\nwhen it comes to trading punches, cracking heads or disinterring the \r\ndead, Ford can still get it done. If he can\'t, his stunt double can.<br><br>The\r\n movie opens in Nevada, where Dr. Jones is caught up in a daring raid on\r\n Area 51 led by Soviet agent Irina Spalko, played by a Cate Blanchett in\r\n a severe black bob, long black rubber gloves and a rapier. (It\'s a \r\nget-up so outrÃ©, even Joe Stalin would smile.) In a twist worthy of \"The\r\n Twilight Zone,\" Indy finds himself in an ersatz small town populated by\r\n cardboard figures watching \"Howdy Doody\" -- a test site for an imminent\r\n A-bomb explosion.<br><br>This bravura, breakneck opening immediately \r\nrekindles the old magic: the mixture of bravado and wit with action \r\nsequences that keep piling on layer upon layer of peril. Unfortunately, \r\nthis is also the high point of the movie, or close to it.<br><br>Indiana\'s\r\n brush with the Reds makes him a person of interest to the FBI just \r\nafter the height of the McCarthy period, a quick, passing nod toward a \r\npost-9/11 sensibility that the movie runs away from almost as \r\ndesperately as Indy scrambles from an army of man-eating ants. At this \r\npoint, screenwriter David Koepp in effect starts the story all over \r\nagain, this time with Brylcreemed biker Mutt Williams (Shia LaBeouf) \r\nmaking a clumsy pitch about rescuing his mom from kidnappers in South \r\nAmerica.<br><br>That, and something about a legendary crystal skull, get\r\n Indiana Jones\' juices churning, and suddenly the old professor and the \r\nyoung tough are off on an adventure.<br><br>This outlandish hokum \r\ndoesn\'t bear close scrutiny, so it\'s probably just as well Dr. Jones is \r\nnot one for introspection. He does his thinking on his feet, and so does\r\n Spielberg, who sometimes seems to be directing this with one eye on the\r\n exit signs.<br><br>It is good to see Karen Allen back as Marion \r\nRavenwood, easily the pick of Indiana\'s women. She lends the enterprise \r\nsome heart that is sorely lacking elsewhere. It\'s just a pity Koepp \r\ncan\'t find more for her to do. (Ray Winstone, as an Indy colleague, is \r\nalso poorly used.)<br><br>A long jungle chase is another bona fide \r\nhighlight, but Spielberg and Lucas misjudge the film\'s extravagant CGI \r\nclimax; I won\'t spoil it here, but it feels alien to Indy\'s world. Let\'s\r\n just say we have seen this before, from Spielberg himself, and done \r\nbetter, too.<br><br>\"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\"\r\n has enough going for it to secure the bronze medal in the series and \r\neven compete for the silver, but \"The Last Crusade\" was a more graceful \r\nfarewell.

If you are interested in hearing why we loved\r\n Horton, the story of an elephant determined to find a safe haven for a \r\ncommunity of tiny people (a.k.a, Whos) that live on a speck of dust and \r\nthat no one else believes exists, read on...<br><br>When I was young my \r\nolder brother enjoyed tormenting me in a number of ways. His favorite \r\nmethod involved coming into my room after I was asleep, late at night, \r\nturning on my overhead light and asking me, \"Hey, Sue, what if we are \r\nall tiny specks living on a tiny world contained in a giantâ€™s \r\nfingernail? What happens when the giant cuts his nails?\" When he was \r\nsure I was awake and his question had registered, he would leave. \r\nWithout turning the lights off. Watching Horton Hears a Who! forcibly \r\nreminded me of those late nights and allowed me to stop feeling quite so\r\n foolish for having pondered his questions.<br><br>The animation and \r\ncolor in this picture are wonderful. The colors are bright and the \r\ncharacters look like Dr. Seuss drawings, not like someone elseâ€™s \r\ninterpretation of Dr. Seuss characters. That visual integrity, \r\nparticularly when presenting a style so deeply ingrained in our \r\ncollective, cultural experience, is the key to hooking viewers from the \r\nvery first moments, and this film successfully meets that challenge. The\r\n only real departures from Seuss-vision, if you will, accompany Hortonâ€™s\r\n flights of imagination, the most memorable of which resembles Japanese \r\nanime, complete with lips moving out of synch with the dialogue, which \r\nmy kids found quite amusing.<br><br>Additionally, Horton (Jim Carrey, \r\nwhose talents are put to good use here) is one of the most delightful \r\ncharacters, animated or otherwise, I can think of in recent movie \r\nhistory. His motto, \"an elephant is faithful 100%\" dovetails nicely with\r\n his firm and oft-repeated conviction that \"a personâ€™s a person, no \r\nmatter how smallâ€ and it is this combination that both makes Horton a \r\ndependable friend and drives the film. It is, perhaps, a minor miracle \r\nthat despite Hortonâ€™s determination and devotion to his ideals, even in \r\nthe face of personal danger, intense social pressure and the threat of \r\nexpulsion from his jungle home, he never becomes preachy or \r\ninsufferable. Heâ€™s just doing what he does, and a big part of what he \r\ndoes involves using his imagination and retaining his sense of humor.<br><br>After\r\n a brow beating by the self-appointed jungle mayor, a \"sour kangaroo\" \r\n(excellently voiced by Carol Burnett) hell-bent on thwarting Horton and \r\nputting the kibosh on imagination in general, Horton moseys away \r\nwondering about her admonition to follow her instructions \"ASAP.\" His \r\nresolution of that expressionâ€™s meaning is likely, I think, to become \r\npart of our family vernacular; he decides it means \"act swiftly awesome \r\npachyderm.\" It is funny and accurate, because Horton is indeed \r\n\"awesome.\"<br><br>Last, but not least, (remember, \"a personâ€™s a person, \r\nno matter how smallâ€) we loved Whoville and its Mayor, Ned (Steve \r\nCarell, another perfect bit of casting). Ned and his wife Sally have 96 \r\ndaughters and one son named Jojo (perhaps the most interesting Who of \r\nall), \"who all share a bathroom.\" Talk about sympathetic characters! Ned\r\n loves his brood and makes sure they all get at least one minute of his \r\ntime each day. He loves his job; it has been in the family for \r\ngenerations. He loves Whoville, and on the surface it seems a pretty \r\nidyllic place, but he canâ€™t shake the feeling, or ignore the mounting \r\nevidence, that something is horribly wrong. Did I already mention heâ€™s a\r\n sympathetic character? Like Horton, Ned is faced with a constituency \r\nthat doesnâ€™t want to hear, and certainly doesnâ€™t believe, that, perhaps,\r\n all is not as it seems.<br><br>Because Horton Hears a Who! is a Dr. \r\nSeuss story, it has a moral and the good guys, Horton and Ned, prevail. \r\nBut this is also a movie version of Dr. Seuss, so getting there takes a \r\nwhile. Because it is a really good movie adaptation of a Dr. Seuss book,\r\n the experience is, like Horton, awesome.</span>\r\n							</div><br>', null, null);

But thatâ€™s \r\nexactly what Run Fatboy Run is. Neither weird nor coming within fifty \r\nmiles of making a direct reference to another film, this seems to play \r\noutside the safety zones of both Pegg and Black. And yet together, under\r\n the direction of TVâ€™s Ross (David Schwimmer â€“- donâ€™t pretend you didnâ€™t\r\n know which Ross I was talking about), the result is a delightfully \r\nendearing piece of modern, mainstream, even somewhat predictable, \r\ncomedy.<br><br>And I loved every minute.<br><br>It was no secret that \r\nSchwimmer was going to attempt to become the Jonathan Frakes of the \r\nFriends troupe, having directed a dozen different episodes of the \r\nlong-running series. But unlike Frakes (who went from starring on and \r\ndirecting episodes of Star Trek: The Next Generation to directing \r\ngawd-awful childrenâ€™s fare like Clockstoppers and Thunderbirds), \r\nSchwimmer comes out swinging with one hell of a directorial debut. Sure,\r\n it isnâ€™t particularly cutting-edge or career redefining. Instead it \r\nplays to his strengths and to the audience most apt to seek out his \r\nwork. Friends, after all, was a weekly episodic romantic comedy that \r\nonly began to run out of steam once every permutation possible between \r\nthe cast members had been played out. So Schwimmer took everything he \r\nlearned on that long-running show and funneled that into a real \r\ncrowd-pleaser of a comedy.<br><br>Rather than focusing upon the standard\r\n boy-meets-girl/boy-loses-girl/boy-gets-girl back formula, Run Fatboy \r\nRun is entirely about the getting girl back portion of the film. As the \r\nfilm opens, Dennis (Simon Pegg) is leaving his pregnant fiancee at the \r\naltar. Cut to five years later and his life is in shambles. The love of \r\nhis life has found someone else and his son might find himself with a \r\nnew and more together father. So he envisions the only thing he can to \r\nwin his family back â€“ run in the same marathon as his ex-fianceeâ€™s new \r\nsuitor.<br><br>But as the film wears on, it becomes less about winning \r\nback the girl and more about winning her and their sonâ€™s respect. Even \r\nas it seems that he may never win her back, the film focuses upon the \r\ntransformation taking place within Dennis as he realizes what heâ€™s \r\nreally fighting for.<br><br>Sound like youâ€™ve heard it all before? Sure \r\nyou have. In fact, watch this long enough and you can even guess the \r\nending in a called shot that probably won\'t impress anyone you know. But\r\n romantic comedies arenâ€™t about where you end up. Theyâ€™re entirely about\r\n how you get there. And it is the how you get there that makes this \r\nsomething special. Here we have two comic talents (Black and Pegg) \r\ntrying their hand at mainstream comedy (including gross-out jokes, \r\nswearing granny/youngster jokes, and a whole bevy of Jerky New Boyfriend\r\n jokes) and in doing so shows you how theyâ€™re done. They donâ€™t try for \r\nthe joke-a-minute formula. Instead they focus on solid, laugh out loud \r\njokes that just plain work. And even if you donâ€™t laugh, they refuse to \r\nlet you roll your eyes. It is razor sharp wit that doesnâ€™t require a \r\nrazor sharp mind to enjoy it.<br><br>Thatâ€™s not to say that this movie \r\naims low. Sure, itâ€™s more accessible than either of the writers is \r\naccustomed to and more along the lines of what Schwimmer is good at, but\r\n it hits everything that it aims for. It is careful, well-crafted comedy\r\n that will appeal to a broad audience. But it doesnâ€™t reinvent the \r\nwheel.

In the sequel, Prince Caspian, the \r\nprincipal actors are a little older and more proficient.<br><br>The \r\ndirector, Andrew Adamson, seems more confident; the action scenes are \r\nsmoother and more polished. The Christian allegories are not as awkward \r\nand heavy-handed.<br><br>It\'s a better movie all around, though still \r\nnot a great one. Like its predecessor, it is plot-heavy, with very \r\nlittle attention paid to characterization. You\'ll recall that there are \r\nfour siblings at the center -- and three of them come off as total \r\nciphers here. It wasn\'t until I re-read my review of the first film that\r\n I remembered that Edmund (Skandar Keynes) used to be rebellious. If he \r\nstill is, there\'s little sign of it. If he isn\'t anymore, then what is \r\nhe instead?<br><br>The Pevensie child who does not get the short shrift \r\nis the oldest, Peter (William Moseley), who returns to Narnia with his \r\nsiblings when they are summoned by a distress call. It\'s been a year for\r\n them, but several centuries in Narnia-time, and a usurping family has \r\nstolen the throne and forced all the Narnian magical creatures into \r\nhiding in the forest. The ruling family\'s teenage Prince Caspian (Ben \r\nBarnes) is now hiding, too, because his uncle, the evil King Miraz \r\n(Sergio Castellitto), having finally produced a male heir for himself, \r\nhas no reason to let Caspian keep living. Miraz is leading the army into\r\n the forest to find and kill Caspian (and any Narnians that get in the \r\nway); Caspian and the Pevensie kids must rally the troops, fight back, \r\nand at last reclaim the throne.<br><br>Peter, now more serious and \r\ngrown-up than the last time we saw him, readily adopts his previous \r\nposition as rightful king of Narnia and deeply considers the options \r\nthat lie before him. Caspian, meanwhile, is more hotheaded and emotional\r\n -- which is understandable, considering his uncle wants to kill him -- \r\nand this leads to recklessness. It also leads, inevitably, to Peter\'s \r\nsister Susan (Anna Popplewell) developing a crush on Caspian, in a \r\nsubplot so underdeveloped that it is an insult to subplots.<br><br>Meanwhile,\r\n young Lucy (Georgie Henley) insists that Aslan, the mighty Jesus-lion, \r\nwill yet return and save the day. Her siblings do not share her faith. \r\nLucy even claims to have glimpsed Aslan here and there. When Peter asks \r\nwhy he didn\'t see him, Lucy says, \"Maybe you weren\'t looking.\" This is \r\nfraught with spiritual import. In fact, everything with Lucy is fraught \r\nthat way.<br><br>Among the new characters the young people encounter are\r\n dwarfs named Trumpkin (Peter Dinklage) and Nikabrik (Warwick Davis), \r\nplus a mouse (voiced by Eddie Izzard) whose small stature has given him a\r\n persecution complex. No one takes a talking mouse seriously, even if he\r\n does have a sword.<br><br>Light touches like that abound in the film, \r\nbut there is ample darkness, too. Its PG rating represents an astounding\r\n lapse in judgment on the part of the MPAA, as the film is rife with \r\nstabbing, slicing, and death. Someone\'s head gets chopped off. Lots of \r\ngood creatures are slain while others look on, powerless to help. Very \r\nlittle blood is actually shown, but still, the slaughter is endless. (I \r\ndon\'t hold the faulty rating against the film itself, of course. I point\r\n it out merely as a reminder for parents with young children.)<br><br>The\r\n battle scenes are well orchestrated and often thrilling. There is also a\r\n chilling sequence where someone contemplates a turn to dark magic, and \r\ntwo horrific creatures, one wolflike and one resembling a ghastly \r\nbird-headed woman, appear. Moments like that give the film some weight, \r\nparticularly insofar as they give the characters something complicated \r\nto think about.<br><br>Predictably, the film\'s running time -- almost 2 \r\n1/2 hours -- feels too long, especially given the story\'s basic \r\nsimplicity. And ultimately, the only way the film makes sense is if it\'s\r\n read as a Christian allegory. Taken strictly at face value, it\'s \r\nnonsensical: If Aslan is all-powerful, why doesn\'t he arrive sooner and \r\ndefeat the bad guys single-handedly? What makes anyone think he\'s going \r\nto come back at all? Why does he come back when he does? What, exactly, \r\nis Aslan\'s connection to everyone? Is he their king? Their god? Their \r\nbuddy? These questions are easily answered if you replace \"Aslan\" with \r\n\"Jesus\" and fill in the biblical blanks, but that limits the movie\'s \r\npotential reach. Someone with no knowledge of Christian theology would \r\nbe baffled by the movie\'s strange narrative and leo ex machina ending.<br><br>Of\r\n course, the only people with no complex knowledge of Christian theology\r\n who are likely to see the film are young children, and they won\'t care \r\nabout the story\'s structural flaws. It\'s the grown-ups who might feel \r\nslightly underwhelmed by it all, though they\'ll likely be moderately \r\nentertained by the action and adventure.</span>\r\n							</div><br>', null, null), ('63', 'Speed Racer', '5', '2012-10-23', 'Speed Racer looks really good.

So this puppy might have been laced \r\nwith in-jokes and homages all over the place that the \"true\" fans will \r\nlove in a big way. If so, I\'m happy for them; but that was not my \r\nexperience. The other caveat is that, by and large, PG films are not for\r\n me. Just the way I\'m wired, I suppose.<br><br>The Speed Racer is played\r\n capably by Emile Hirsch. The film starts with him as a wee lad hanging \r\nout with his big brother Rex Racer, a professional racer on the WRL \r\ncircuit. The film flashes forward and then back again quite a bit during\r\n the initial stages (the film is over two hours, by the way). \r\nEssentially, Speed Racer, along with Pops (John Goodman), Trixie \r\n(Christina Ricci), Mom (Susan Sarandon), the kid brother, and monkey, \r\ngets embroiled in a face-off against the corporate powers that be. Three\r\n major races break up the movie and provide a bit of adult relief from \r\nthe threadbare plot.<br><br>Logically, everything makes sense here. The \r\nvillains are clear and their motivations apparent -- the family and \r\nSpeed are gallant and determined in their efforts to make theirs the \r\nbest racing team on the circuit. Matthew Fox takes a spin as Racer X, \r\nthe man with shadowy intentions and phenomenal driving moves. The whole \r\nfilm feels a bit noir in terms of tone, but the blaring effects don\'t \r\nallow for much introspection overall. This would be a difficult film to \r\nhate but not a difficult film to be a bit bored by. Again, and it bears \r\nrepeating as this one carries the Wachowski brothers\' (The Matrix, V for\r\n Vendetta) signature; this is a film for those not looking for anything \r\ntoo intellectually challenging.<br><br>I would highly recommend Speed \r\nRacer for families seeking a visual treat. I\'m less than optimistic that\r\n this will appeal to adults who weren\'t big fans of the original. It \r\ndoesn\'t strike me as a date movie either: though Ricci and Hirsch have \r\nnice chemistry, the PG factor dulls it down a bit. However, I will say \r\nif your choices are between this and What Happens in Vegas... you \r\nshouldn\'t think twice because that film is putrid by comparison. Aw, who\r\n am I kidding?

I should knowâ€”over the past few \r\nyears, Iâ€™ve reviewed many of these accessories, which typically combine \r\nan iPod dock, an amplifier, speakers, and a remote control. And while \r\nmany iPod speaker systems make considerable compromises between sound \r\nquality, size, and convenience, some are quite impressive. When Iâ€™ve \r\nreviewed the best of these productsâ€”take Klipschâ€™s $400 iFi or Jamoâ€™s \r\n$400 i300 as examplesâ€”I\'ve often noted that users would be hard-pressed \r\nto put together a system on their own that sounds better for the same \r\namount of money.<br><br>But that got me thinking: how difficult would \r\ndoing so be? With some smart shopping, could you create a systemâ€”an \r\namplifier, an iPod dock with remote, and speakersâ€”that competes on both \r\nprice and performance with the best systems specifically made for the \r\niPod?<br><br>I decided to find out. I searched for components to make my\r\n own iPod speaker system, with the ultimate goal being a noticeable \r\nupgrade in sound quality over good iPod speaker systems in the same \r\nprice range (which means connecting an iPod dock to a $300 â€œbookshelf \r\nstereoâ€ with mediocre sound quality wouldnâ€™t cut it).<br><br>Why go \r\nthrough the trouble? After all, if there are already good systems out \r\nthere for $300 to $400, why not just plunk down your money and start \r\nlistening instead of going to the trouble of rounding up the parts \r\nyourself? For starters, a system with separate speakers has the \r\npotential to sound better than an all-in-one box. Second, by buying the \r\ncomponents separately, youâ€™re future-proofing your system: you can later\r\n upgrade to a better amplifier, or a nice receiver, and even use the \r\nsystem for listening to CDs or radio. Apple could also make changes to \r\nfuture iPod models that render current iPod speaker systems obsolete; \r\nwith a custom stereo, you can just buy a new dock instead of having to \r\nreplace the whole thing. Finally, as an audio guy who also reviews iPod \r\nspeakers, I simply wanted to see what was possible.<br><br>The ground rules<br><br>To truly replace a dedicated iPod speaker system, my build-it-yourself stereo had to meet several requirements:<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n * iPod dock: A cradle that connects to an iPodâ€™s dock-connector port is\r\n necessary for high-quality sound and the ability to control playback \r\nusing a wireless remote. (See the next item.)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Remote control: A\r\n wireless remote for controlling basic iPod playback \r\n(play/pause/back/forward) is a must. The capability to control volume \r\nlevel is a bonus.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Good sound quality: If my DIY system wasnâ€™t \r\ngoing to sound as good as, or better than, whatâ€™s already out there, \r\nthere was no point in pursuing this exercise. Thankfully, there are many\r\n inexpensive speakers on the market that sound great. And, as I noted \r\nabove, separate left/right speakers have some clear advantages over \r\none-box systems: separate speakers can provide much better stereo \r\nseparation and imaging than speakers confined to a one-piece box; you \r\noften get better-quality components; and you can place components where \r\nyou want them or where they sound the bestâ€”you donâ€™t need a single, \r\nlarge â€œfootprintâ€ on your desk or dresser.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Itâ€™s also worth \r\nnoting that a quality pair of standalone speakers will likely be with \r\nyou long after an iPod speaker system has found its way onto CraigsList \r\nor the electronics-recycling pile.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Relatively-compact size and \r\ndecent appearance: With separate speakers, a DIY stereo is going to take\r\n up more room than a desktop system, but I wanted to keep it small \r\nenough to fit on a desk, dresser, or counter.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In terms of \r\nappearance, while there are some inexpensive amplifiers that perform \r\nsurprisingly well, including ones you can solder together yourself, many\r\n are bulky and ugly. I didnâ€™t expect to be able to put something \r\ntogether that looked like B&amp;Wâ€™s $600 Zeppelin, but I hoped to create\r\n a system that wouldnâ€™t look like something I built using parts from \r\nRadio Shack.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Reasonable price: Although there are iPod speaker \r\nsystems out there that cost $4,000 (or more), many of our favoritesâ€”ones\r\n that offer excellent sound quality and a good feature setâ€”are in the \r\n$300 to $400 range.

The utility of that [desktop] interface becomes \r\nless and less useful to the end-user as it gets more and more \r\ncluttered,\" said Shervin Pishevar, co-founder and CEO of Social Gaming \r\nNetwork (SGN). Thus, taking a bold step to clean up the member profile \r\ninterface is a logical and natural enhancement for Facebook to make, he \r\nsaid.<br><br>Facebook has been talking about its redesign for a while, \r\nbut this week provided concrete details about its plans, which are aimed\r\n at retaining the layout\'s orderly and clean look, a differentiator from\r\n competitors like MySpace.<br><br>At the heart of the redesign is the \r\nredistribution of profile content into different tabs so that users can \r\nbetter organize components such as the activity feed, photos, personal \r\ninformation, and applications. In addition, the activity feed tab will \r\nfeature a new authoring control panel for creating and posting content \r\ncalled the Publisher Box. Moreover, the profile will have at the top a \r\nnew horizontal navigation line with drop-down menus for its core \r\nfeatures.<br><br>\"The three main goals we have for this are: to make the\r\n profiles simple and clean; to give users control; and to let them \r\nemphasize the most recent and relevant content. This is what we\'ve come \r\nup with as the best way to accomplish those goals,\" said Facebook\'s Mark\r\n Slee, the product manager of the new design.<br><br>Of course, any user\r\n interface change of this magnitude entails dangers, especially when it \r\nwill affect about 70 million end-users and thousands of application \r\ndevelopers. Facebook has experienced backlash from changes in the past, \r\nsuch as the initial versions of its activity feed feature and Beacon \r\nadvertising program, both of which were criticized for being too \r\nintrusive on people\'s privacy.<br><br>\"It\'s a pretty significant \r\nredesign, so users will definitely have an adjustment period,\" \r\nO\'Shaughnessy said. \"People are generally opposed to change, so there\'ll\r\n be a pretty reasonable amount of consternation from users just because \r\nit\'s different.\"<br><br>This is why O\'Shaughnessy has been surprised \r\nthat Facebook is opting to roll out all the changes at once, as opposed \r\nto doing it more gradually, since the latter approach might lessen the \r\nimpact on end-users. \"It\'s always a risk to roll out a really big change\r\n all at once,\" he said.<br><br>Yet, Slee is confident that the change \r\nwon\'t be traumatic for end-users, since Facebook has been actively \r\ncommunicating the changes and plans via a Facebook group. Facebook also \r\nplans to have a time during which end-users will be able to toggle back \r\nand forth between the old and new layout, before the change is finalized\r\n at some point in June, Slee said.<br><br>From the application developer\r\n perspective, the redesign will also have significant effects, \r\nO\'Shaughnessy said. \"The applications aren\'t present nearly as much as \r\nthey were before,\" he said, alluding to the fact that the new design \r\ngroups applications into a separate tab.<br><br>Although users will be \r\nable to create tabs for individual applications and the new top-level \r\nnavigation includes a drop-down list of applications, \"there\'s \r\ndefinitely the capability for apps to be less discoverable,\" \r\nO\'Shaughnessy said. \"For newer developers especially, that\'ll be really \r\nhard.\"<br><br>Not that O\'Shaughnessy worries about being affected by \r\nthis. Hungry Machine began launching its applications in mid-2007, \r\nshortly after Facebook opened its platform to external developers, and \r\nthey have gained very good traction and popularity, and are generating a\r\n healthy revenue stream.<br><br>However, Facebook argues that the new \r\ndesign will be good for developers, not only because applications can \r\nget their own tabs, but because users will be able to add application \r\ncontrols to the Publisher Box. \"All applications will be able to tie \r\nright into that. We think that\'s a huge opportunity for developers,\" \r\nSlee said.<br><br>Meanwhile, having an entire tab devoted to \r\napplications will let developers \"build a rich and deep experience that \r\ncan take advantage of more space than has ever been provided in the \r\nprofile,\" Slee said, adding that Facebook is opening a \"sandbox\" for \r\ndevelopers to get acquainted with the profile changes.<br><br>Boris \r\nSilver, co-founder and CEO of Sport Interactiva, a developer of \r\nsport-themed games, also believes that end-users are likely to recoil at\r\n first and that visibility for applications in general will be \r\ndiminished, but believes the changes will ultimately be for the better, \r\nparticularly for companies like his whose applications are firmly \r\nestablished on Facebook. \"It\'ll give room to high-quality and useful \r\napplications that people value most to rise up,\" Silver said.<br><br>Pishevar\r\n holds a similar view, saying that the changes will benefit applications\r\n that are genuinely engaging and of high quality, and not those that try\r\n to succeed via in-your-face, aggressive self-promotion tactics, \r\nsomething Facebook has been trying to discourage among developers.<br><br>\"The\r\n apps shouldn\'t be reliant on real estate on a profile page to thrive. \r\nThere was tremendous benefits early on in the platform from having that \r\nreal estate, but it also made it probably too easy to get users without \r\nactually investing real resources into making quality, highly engaging \r\napplications,\" Pishevar said.<br><br>Despite the possible bumps in the \r\nroad, the developers interviewed agreed that, as far as the actual \r\nredesign is concerned, Facebook is hitting the right notes. \"I\'m pretty \r\nhigh on the design itself.
