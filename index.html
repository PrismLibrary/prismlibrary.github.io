		<h1>Prism</h1>
		<p>Prism is a framework for building loosely coupled, maintainable, and testable XAML applications in WPF, Windows 10 UWP, and Xamarin Forms. Separate releases are available for each platform and those will be developed on independent timelines. Prism provides an implementation of a collection of design patterns that are helpful in writing well-structured and maintainable XAML applications, including MVVM, dependency injection, commands, EventAggregator, and others. Prism's core functionality is a shared code base in a Portable Class Library targeting these platforms. Those things that need to be platform specific are implemented in the respective libraries for the target platform. Prism also provides great integration of these patterns with the target platform. For example, Prism for UWP and Xamarin Forms allows you to use an abstraction for navigation that is unit testable, but that layers on top of the platform concepts and APIs for navigation so that you can fully leverage what the platform itself has to offer, but done in the MVVM way.</p>
		<p>Prism 6 is a fully open source version of the Prism guidance <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2015/03/19/prism-grows-up/">originally produced by Microsoft patterns & practices</a>. The core team members were all part of the p&p team that developed Prism 1 through 5, and the effort has now been turned over to the open source community to keep it alive and thriving to support the .NET community. There are thousands of companies who have adopted previous versions of Prism for WPF, Silverlight, and Windows Runtime, and we hope they will continue to move along with us as we continue to evolve and enhance the framework to keep pace with current platform capabilities and requirements.</p>
		<p>At the current time we have no plans to create new versions of the library for Silverlight or for Windows 8/8.1/WP8.1. For those you can still use the previous releases from Microsoft p&p <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/Gg430869%28v=PandP.40%29.aspx">here</a> and <a href="http://prismwindowsruntime.codeplex.com/">here</a>. If there is enough interest and contributors to do the work, we can consider it, but it is not on our roadmap for now.</p>
		
		<h2>Help Support Prism</h2>
		<p>As most of you know, it takes a lot of time and effort for our small team to manage and maintain Prism in our spare time. Even though Prism is open source and hosted on GitHub, there are a number of costs associated with maintaining a project such as Prism. If you would like to help support us, the easiest thing you can do is watch our Pluralsight courses on Prism. By watching our courses, not only do you help support the project financially, but you might also learn something along the way. We believe this is a win-win for everyone.</p>
